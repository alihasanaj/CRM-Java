# Projects

Two Prjects that I've worked on to improve my programming skills.

The first assignment that I finished for school is the 8 Queens Game made in C++. It has its own GUI which includes the main menu,
score page and the game page.

The second assignment is a personal project which is a simple CRM web application that I made with the help from a Udemy course for the 
Javca Spring and Hibernate framework. 

Update 1.0: Add support for login and roles restriction and password encryption using bcrypt that spring security offers.
